# SMART MANAGEMENT OF BINS

**Project Name** - Smart Management of Bins


**Area** - Embedded Systems, IoT

**Technolgies** - In Application Programming (IAP), Watchdog Timer (WDT), Flash Over Through Air (FOTA), GSM-2G Communication, GNSS, TCP, HTTP, FTP, I2C, Concurrency, UART, Serial Communication, Antenna Chip Design, GPIOs, ARM Cortex M0, M0516LDN, Arduino Nano

**Hardware** - ARM Cortex M0 M0516LDN

**Programming** - Embedded C

**Description** -

1. Measured the environmental quatities using sensors (Ultrasonic, IR, keypad, GSM) user input.
2. Abstracted the the senor data and sent it to server (cloud) for data handling and analysis.
3. Created to keep track of goods/objects loaded and unloaded form dockyard (or any environmental settings). 
4. Deployed for the client to keep track of packed and unpacked medicince pouches/bags in his inventory.
5. Use advanced features lik In Application Programming & Flash Over Throught Air to boot the device with updated new firmware remotely.
